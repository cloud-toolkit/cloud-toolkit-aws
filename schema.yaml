      Types of Email Notifications that are covered by Email Sender.

      * Bounce usually occurs when the recipient address does not exist, their inbox is full, the content of the message if flagged or other casuistics.

      * Complaint indicates that the recipient does not want the email that was sent to them. It is usually a proactive action and it is best to remove the recipient address from the mailing list whenever it is.

      * Delivery marks an email as correctly delivered.
